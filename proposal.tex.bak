\section{Project Summary}
Several services exist to connect renters to landlords, the environment for dedicated 
rental apps is still an open one. As single purpose web apps become more ubiquitous, 
users have come to expect more than what online classified such as Kijiji can offer.
\\\\
The goal of this project is to develop a cross platform web application that provides 
a better way for tenants to find housing, and better way for landlords to fill 
vacancies. One of the most successful businesses to come out of web applications, 
AirBnB, is built on a similar premise. By providing a simple, single purpose 
interface, it harnessed a market that was currently dissatisfied with the 
requirements of posting advertisements for short term housing. 
\\\\
AirBnB has served as a case study for property based business.


\section{Specification of Requirements}
The application seeks to provide an effective alternitive to online and real world 
classified for rental p


\section{Preliminary Project Plan}
	\subsection{Current Phase: Definition of Requirements}
	Identify resource and knowledge requirements. Develop hosting ecosystem and set up developer environment.
	
	\subsection{Design}
	
	
	\subsection{Development}
	
	
	\subsection{Testing}
	Testing of all applications (Browser based, Mobile platforms), will be a continuous
	part of the development phase. At each feature milestone, the new features will be
	added to the staging build for presentation to the customer for approval and 
	recommendations. Once all features have been integrated, the staging build will 
	undergo a period of robust testing of all pages and features. 

	\subsection{Acceptance}
	Upon completion of testing, the staging build will be migrated to the production
	platform and presented to the customer. Any requested final modifications will be 
	made in the staging build. Migration will again take place from staging to 
	production until the final acceptance signature is provided.
	
\section{Development Environment}
	\subsection{Server Environment}
	The application will be hosted in multiple locations based on the stage of 
	development. Each team member will have a virtual \textbf{Development Environment} 
	on their working machine. This will low members to work regardless of internet 
	connectivity and without fear of conflicts with other testing. Changes will be 
	integrated into a \textbf{Staging environment} to ensure that integration into the 
	cloud hosted environment is successful. Once all features are complete, the 
	application will be migrated to the \textbf{Production Environment}.
	\\\\
	Each enviroment will be built as a LAMP stack. LAMP provides the Linux operating 
	System, Apache Web Server, MySQL database and PHP CGI scripting. The application 
	will be developed using \textbf{Laravel 5}, an open source PHP framework.
	\subsection{Front End Framework}
	One of the most important aspects of any public application is the aethetics and 
	functionality of the interface. Providing a novel, useful service, behind an ugly or
	unusable interface is enough to doom a product. Several front end frameworks exist
	to aid in te rapid development of useable cross platform interfaces. To fill this 
	need, the Bootstrap front end framework will provide the groundwork for our front end
	developers.
	\subsection{Documentation Maintenance}
	There will be two main collections of documentation:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Developer Documentation
	\item Feature Documentation
	\end{itemize}
